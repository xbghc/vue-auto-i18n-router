Traditional VitePress multi-language setup requires manual handling of routing and language detection. This plugin provides an elegant automated solution, letting you focus on content creation instead of routing configuration.

### Key Benefits

- **Simple Integration** - Just add the plugin and theme enhancement, no need to modify existing code
- **Smart Detection** - Automatically detects and remembers user language preferences
- **Development Friendly** - Works perfectly in both development and production environments
- **Platform Compatible** - Supports all static hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
pnpm add -D vitepress-auto-i18n-router

# Configure and start
pnpm docs:dev
```

Visit the site root, and the plugin will automatically detect your browser language and redirect to the appropriate version!
